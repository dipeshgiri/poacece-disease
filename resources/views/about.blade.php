    <button>What is our project about?</button><br /><br />
    <h2>
      This is a project we made for our final year. It is a simple plant disease
      prediction and the nutrient deficiency, plants may have during their
      growing period. <br />
      <br />
      In this project, we have utilized machine learning and deep learning to
      feed the computer system about many possible diseases and lack of
      nutrients on the crops. <br />
      <br />Using this technology, our project will be able to identify the
      diseases that has halt the crops growing. Likewise, what may be the
      nutrient deficiency in our crops.
